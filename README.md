## Visualization

This repository uses **Manim** for animations. You can find installation instructions at [https://www.manim.community](https://www.manim.community).

* **Python files** in the repo are for Manim animations.
* **C++ files** are for solutions to the puzzles.

To render an animation for a puzzle, run:

```bash
manim -pql day{dayNumber}/p1.py
```

For example, to render the animation for part one of day 1:

```bash
manim -pql day01/p1.py
```
